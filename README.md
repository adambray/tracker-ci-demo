## Tracker Spring Boot Project

Welcome to the *Tracker* Spring Boot project.

This is a template project built with an accelerator that:

-   Uses the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) to
    boot strap a Spring Boot project with the following dependencies:
    - Spring WebMVC
    - Spring Data JPA
    - H2 embedded database
    - Actuator
    - Spring Boot testing
    
-   A continuous integration pipeline using Github Actions.
    By pushing this code to the default main branch on a Github remote
    will automatically run a Continuous Integration build and test.
